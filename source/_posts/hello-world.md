### <center> Hello </center>

<center>Adele</center>

<center>Written byï¼šAdele Adkins/Greg Kurstin</center>

<center>Hello it's me</center>

<!-- more -->

<center>I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet</center>

<center>To go over everything</center>

<center>They say that time's supposed to heal ya but I ain't done much healing</center>

<center>Hello can you hear me</center>

<center>I'm in california dreaming about who we used to be</center>

<center>When we were younger and free</center>

<center>I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet</center>

<center>There's such a difference between us</center>

<center>And a million miles</center>

<center>Hello from the other side</center>

<center>I must've called a thousand times to tell you</center>

<center>I'm sorry for everything that I've done</center>

<center>But when I call you never seem to be home</center>

<center>Hello from the outside</center>

<center>At least I can say that I've tried to tell you</center>

<center>I'm sorry for breaking your heart</center>

<center>But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</center>

<center>Hello how are you</center>

<center>It's so typical of me to talk about myself</center>

<center>I'm sorry I hope that you're well</center>

<center>Did you ever make it out of that town</center>

<center>Where nothing ever happened</center>

<center>It's no secret</center>

<center>That the both of us are running out of time</center>

<center>Hello from the other side</center>

<center>I must've called a thousand times to tell you</center>

<center>I'm sorry for everything that I've done</center>

<center>But when I call you never seem to be home</center>

<center>Hello from the outside</center>

<center>At least I can say that I've tried to tell you</center>

<center>I'm sorry for breaking your heart</center>

<center>But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</center>

<center>Ooooohh anymore</center>

<center>Ooooohh anymore</center>

<center>Ooooohh anymore</center>

<center>Anymore</center>

<center>Hello from the other side</center>

<center>I must've called a thousand times to tell you</center>

<center>I'm sorry for everything that I've done</center>

<center>But when I call you never seem to be home</center>

<center>Hello from the outside</center>

<center>At least I can say that I've tried to tell you</center>

<center>I'm sorry for breaking your heart</center>

<center>But it don't matter it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore</center>
